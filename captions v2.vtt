00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.450 line:88%
Imagine if the day after you purchased a home, its value dropped by 20% and

2
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.640 line:88%
continued to drop every single day.

3
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.440 line:88%
You would never make that investment.

4
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.280 line:88%
Yet, that's exactly what happens when you buy a car.

5
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.040 line:88%
The moment you drive it off the lot, it loses 20% of its value

6
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.120 line:88%
and continues to lose value, every day.

7
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.320 line:88%
Not to mention, the thousands you'll spend on maintenance and insurance.

8
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.000 line:88%
For a century, people have been buying cars because they've had no other option.

9
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.000 line:88%
Until now.

10
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.480 line:88%
Flexcar is completely reimagining car ownership.

11
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.180 line:88%
You can drive what you want, when you want.

12
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.180 line:88%
Cruise in a Jeep for the summer.

13
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.197 line:88%
switch to an SUV for the winter.

14
00:00:46.197 --> 00:00:49.150 line:88%
Or stick with your favorite ride for years.

15
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.070 line:88%
The choice is yours.

16
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.070 line:88%
And the best part,

17
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.140 line:88%
it costs less than a monthly car loan.

18
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.090 line:88%
No down payment, no debt, no locked in contracts.

19
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.050 line:88%
Just the newest cars with the latest technology,

20
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.000 line:88%
with maintenance and insurance included.

21
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.125 line:88%
That's the freedom of Flexcar.

22
00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:09.150 line:88%
The world's first month-to-month car lease.

23
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.300 line:88%
Once you Flex, you'll never buy a car again.
