00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.450
Imagine if the day after you purchased a home, its value dropped by 20% and

2
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.200
continued

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.640
to drop every single day.

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.440
You would never make that investment.

5
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.280
Yet, that's exactly what happens when you buy a car.

6
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.460
The moment you drive it off the lot, it loses 20% of its value and continues to

7
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.240
lose value

8
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.120
every day.

9
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.320
Not to mention, the thousands you'll spend on maintenance and insurance.

10
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.680
For a century, people have been buying cars because they've had no other option

11
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.000
.

12
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.480
Until now, Flex Car is completely reimagining car ownership.

13
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.600
You can drive what you want, when you want, cruise in a jeep for the summer,

14
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.240
switch to

15
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.680
an SUV for the winter, or stick with your favorite ride for years, the choice

16
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.480
is yours.

17
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.090
In the best part, it costs less than a monthly car loan, no down payment, no

18
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.200
debt, no locked

19
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.070
in contracts, just the newest cars in the latest technology, with maintenance

20
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.000
and insurance

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
included.

22
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.440
That's the freedom of Flex Car, the world's first month-to-month car lease.

23
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.640
Once you flex, you'll never buy a car again.
