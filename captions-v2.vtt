00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.895 line:88%
Imagine if the day after you purchased a home

2
00:00:04.895 --> 00:00:07.350 line:88%
its value dropped by 20%

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.310 line:88%
and continued to drop every single day.

4
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.820 line:88%
You would never make that investment.

5
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.980 line:88%
Yet that's exactly what happens when you buy a car.

6
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.157 line:88%
The moment you drive it off the lot, it loses 20% of its value

7
00:00:20.157 --> 00:00:23.699 line:88%
and continues to lose value, every day.

8
00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.090 line:88%
Not to mention, the thousands you'll spend on maintenance and insurance.

9
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.964 line:88%
For a century

10
00:00:29.964 --> 00:00:33.437 line:88%
people have been buying cars because they've had no other option.

11
00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:36.337 line:88%
Until now.

12
00:00:36.337 --> 00:00:40.200 line:88%
Flexcar is completely reimagining car ownership.

13
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.777 line:88%
You can drive what you want, when you want.

14
00:00:42.777 --> 00:00:44.680 line:88%
Cruise in a Jeep for the summer,

15
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.807 line:88%
switch to an SUV for the winter,

16
00:00:46.807 --> 00:00:49.640 line:88%
or stick with your favorite ride for years.

17
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.280 line:88%
The choice is yours.

18
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.310 line:88%
And the best part,

19
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.560 line:88%
it costs less than a monthly car loan.

20
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.390 line:88%
No down payment, no debt, no locked in contracts.

21
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.460 line:88%
Just the newest cars and the latest technology

22
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.550 line:88%
with maintenance and insurance included.

23
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.625 line:88%
That's the freedom of Flexcar.

24
00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:10.080 line:88%
The world's first month-to-month car lease.

25
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.072 line:88%
Once you Flex, you'll never buy a car again.
